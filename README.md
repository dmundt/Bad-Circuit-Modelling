# Bad Circuit Modelling

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jatinchowdhury18/Bad-Circuit-Modelling.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jatinchowdhury18/Bad-Circuit-Modelling)

This repository contains models of non-ideal circuits. The idea is to model
realistic variations in circuits, caused by things like imperfect components,
age, temperature, etc.

For each non-ideal circuit concept, we present simulation code, an example
plugin (VST, AU) built with JUCE, and an explanatory article, available
as either a Jupyter Notebook, or a Medium post.

Current non-ideal circuit concepts include:

**1. Component Tolerances**
